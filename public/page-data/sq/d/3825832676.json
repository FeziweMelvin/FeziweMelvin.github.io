Weather conditions, precipitation, weekday, season, the hour of the day, and so on can all influence renting behaviour. The goal is to predict bike rental count (hourly/daily) based on the environmental &#x26; seasonal settings</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Email Spam Detection","tech":["NLP","Python","Machine Learning","Classification"],"github":"https://github.com/FeziweMelvin/Email-spam-detection-using-naive-bayes","external":""},"html":"<p>Because of the increase in the volume of unwanted emails known as spam, there is an urgent need for the creation of more dependable and strong antispam filters. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been effectively utilized to detect and filter spam emails. In this study, I introduce a Supervised learning system for spam detection and classification.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Everytown Gun Law Rankings","tech":["Machine Learning","Data Alysis"],"github":"https://github.com/FeziweMelvin/Credit-card-fraud","external":""},"html":"<p>Credit card companies must be able to detect fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items they did not purchase.
